# Future Development Ideas

- Implement support for multiple simultaneous users
- Implement better support for asking the agents the same question multiple times. Currently if the user asks the same question more than once, only one answer distribution will be visible on the website. However, the answers are correctly added to the downloadable csv-files.
- Testing and analyzing the program with various training datasets and language models
- Reducing the number of agents by using clustering (to achieve a more relevant agent sample)
- Facilitating the change of the agent training data (enabling users to easily add their own training data for the agents within the program)
- Testing with negative or adverse scenarios
- Incorporating a theoretical framework and training the language model accordingly
- Investigating the reasoning behind the language model’s responses (understanding why the LLM arrives at certain conclusions and what justifications it provides for its answers)
- Identifying what additional information should be provided to the LLM to enable it to generate high-quality responses (including situations where the LLM may itself recognize that the problem is too complex)
- If the training data reveals clear differences between specific groups, should these groups be analyzed separately? (for example, in the current dataset, women’s responses were consistently more positive than men’s—could separate analysis yield interesting insights?)
