# ECO-STATES

In this scenario, Member States shape a social and economic
transformation of the EU by improving the effectiveness and
efficiency of their government action, in particular via policy
mixes. They prove capable of implementing reforms that allow an
inclusive green transition while strengthening their coordination
to jointly address challenges that countries cannot tackle alone.
Governments and the state are dominant and have a high capacity
to shape the lifestyles of individuals.

## Dimensions

### Social

1. Society values stability, conformity to social rules and a utilitarian approach
   to nature. National identities remain strong, but people also share a
   European identity. Patriotism takes over nationalism.

2. Social inequalities have been reduced through redistributive policies. Social
   protection, healthcare and other public services are strong, with universal
   access for all.

3. Data governance is strong, and governments fight disinformation.

### Technological

1. Governments invest in digital infrastructure and in technological
   innovation for sustainability. Digital tools are widespread and allow
   governments to closely monitor production, natural resources and society.

2. Global platforms and virtual worlds are popular and used by governments to
   test and promote their policies and sustainable lifestyles.

### Economic

1. A sustainable social market economy is supported by comprehensive
   changes in the Member States’ tax systems and by fiscal reform coordinated
   at the EU level.

2. The financial sector redirects financial flows towards sustainable activities,
   also based on a comprehensive ‘green taxonomy’ of economic activities.

3. Businesses have adapted to the highly regulated environment in the best
   interest of society. Unemployment is low, with public jobs widely available
   and flexible.

### Environmental

1. Governments focus on food security and related risks, including investing
   in alternative foodstuffs.

2. Energy markets are highly centralised, with the EU regulating prices.

3. The green transition is shaped by strong national governments. By
   combining multiple instruments into a policy mix, they set the direction and
   coordinate with local and EU levels.

### Political

1. Top-down decision-making with new competences such as taxes, energy
   and some social policy shifted to the EU level.

2. Strong central governments at the national level consult regional and
   local authorities, as well as citizens and civil society, but keep a strong
   policy focus on sustainability to which individual liberties are sometimes
   sacrificed.

### Geopolitical

1. Persisting world order with international organisations and military alliances
   coordinating peace, climate, trade and security talks.

2. The EU among leaders of global climate change mitigation and adaptation,
   with the USA and China achieving similar levels of climate neutrality.

3. Internet, digital infrastructure and satellite systems are interoperable globally.

## Transition pathway towards EU 2050

### Signs of new in 2023

The crises at the beginning of the 2020s found the
EU only partly prepared to respond, with Member
States eager to retain competences and leeway
on their budgets and internal matters. However,
progressive, conservative and occasionally
populist forces have found themselves compelled
to take similar lines in such cases, resulting in
an overarching nonpartisan agenda on how to
respond to the crises. Measures addressing the
effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and escalation
of the Russian war in Ukraine are paving the way
for new competences and working methods at
the EU level with strong economic and political
coordination, as well as binding objectives and
comprehensive legislation on the green and
digital transition and investing in social equality
and cohesion. The 2021 global agreement
on minimum corporate tax may signal new
momentum for fiscal reforms.

### Main patterns of change

#### Using a portfolio of interventions, such as legislation, education and public engagement, to turn consumers into ecology-conscious citizens

By the late 2020s, the combined pressure from
a fast-changing climate and unprecedented
weather extremes had pushed EU governments to
accelerate the green transition. During the 2020s,
they adopted ambitious reforms that explicitly
promoted ‘green’ lifestyles and discouraged
pollution and wasteful production. Subsidies
on fossil fuels or non-renewable materials
were removed, and industrial production was
forced to save on resources through stringent
requirements on recycling, reuse and repair
of goods. Even the advertisement of some
products and practices commonly considered
environmentally unsustainable, such as frequent
flying or powerful private cars, became unpopular
and were gradually restricted. In parallel, Member
States started to use nudges and awareness-
raising campaigns, also through targeted
communication using AI, to steer people’s
behaviour. As an example, influencers were paid
by public authorities to promote sustainable diets
and lifestyles, including certified sustainable food
supply chains and sufficiency. Publicly funded
research was directed to develop and bring to
the market a variety of alternative, lower impact
consumption goods.

By 2030, Member States agreed to review
educational curricula and lifelong learning
programmes to mainstream sustainability
competences and invest in fostering digital
literacy and participatory decision-making. This
change increased people’s consciousness about
the environmental impacts of their consumption
and empowered them to adopt new lifestyles.
At that stage, the EU had invested in developing
measuring tools for personal carbon footprints,
which start to be implemented across the Member
States. This policy mix succeeded in transforming
consumer behaviour to match new models of
social status based on eco-consciousness.

In the 2030s, governments involved civil society
and citizens more systematically in decision-
making. Building on the follow-up actions of the
Conference on the Future of Europe in 2020,
they started using digital deliberative democracy
mechanisms to engage directly with citizens,
build trust and further empower social dialogues.

Building on its new sources of revenue, and to
prevent social unrest, the EU boosted its funds
for cohesion and social inclusion. This first
wave of intervention was used to deliver equal
access to quality services across all EU regions.
After 2040, in a second wave of intervention, a
strong sustainability agenda was acknowledged
to be of systemic importance and adopted in all
EU Member States. To secure continuity in the
political endorsement of the necessary reforms,
voting was made compulsory, and rules around
electoral mandates were amended.

#### Substantial fiscal reforms for sustainability

From the 2030s, prodded by active policy and
changed taxation, citizens embraced sufficiency and
green lifestyles. This embrace caused consumption
to lose importance as a base for taxation. At the
same time, the need for social services increased
steadily (in particular, health and long-term care
due to the ageing population). The demand for
public expenditure in climate change mitigation
and adaptation, as well as for public services, kept
growing, requiring substantial public revenues.
By the 2030s, advanced digital technology and
AI allowed accurate monitoring and simplified
collection of taxes by governments, overcoming
mistrust among Member States regarding claims
of corruption and tax evasion that had hurdled the
way to a fiscal union during the 2020s.

By the 2040s, the Member States recognised
that divergences in national tax systems hamper
progress. Through changes to EU treaties, they
entrusted the EU with harmonising the national
tax systems. Wealth accumulation and extra
profits ended up being clearly at odds with the
prevalent social norms and the new political
vision for sustainability. EU-level harmonisation
bought political support to shift the tax burden
from labour towards capital, property, high income
and inheritance, VAT on nonessential products
and corporate income taxes (with control of
capital at the EU borders). The EU also progressed
in implementing the EU Emissions Trading
System (ETS) and the Carbon Border Adjustment
Mechanism (CBAM) as sources of own resources
income. The introduction of more environmental
and health taxes created price signals delivering
several collective benefits. For example, boosting
taxes on alcohol, sugar and chemicals detrimental
to health fostered healthy lifestyles and relieved
pressure on healthcare systems.

The wars and global crises of the 2020s showed
the value of international cooperation, in health
and climate policies as well as in fiscal affairs.
EU tax initiatives negotiated with other major
economies (China, India, the USA) finally led to the
implementation of an OECD-led agreement on a
high minimum corporate tax internationally. This
step curtailed global tax avoidance significantly,
eliminating tax evasion and tax havens.

#### State-led technology development for sustainability

Prompted by the EU Digital Decade, by 2030 the
Member States had invested heavily in digital
infrastructure and implemented comprehensive
digital skills agendas. The provision of digital
technology and inclusion measures for vulnerable
people (e.g. ensuring language support, additional
tuition, AI-assisted personal learning) helped
decrease digital poverty and promoted digital
skills broadly. Increased public funds for research
enabled broad-ranging technology development
and sparked a new wave of incremental green
innovation. Major investments in the 2020s
helped improve the capacity of some EU Member
States to become new global leaders in renewable
energy technologies, particularly hydrogen
and photovoltaics, electric vehicle production,
desalination and waste-recycling technologies,
with positive spill-over effects in the EU.

During the 2030s and 2040s, Member States
fully subscribed to a ‘mission' approach to
policies, pooling funds, harmonising regulation
and mobilising public and private actors in setting
priorities and creating sustainable long-term
solutions. State-funded incubation labs flourished,
while green public procurement, up-scaled smart
specialisation and industrial cluster programmes
facilitated the diffusion of technology. The
European Investment Bank (EIB) created a public
venture capital fund and started to manage a pool
of patents obtained from financed businesses to
be at the disposal of EU firms.

The digitalisation of the public sector in the 2020s
enhanced efficiency and access to public education
and training, healthcare and social services for all
citizens. Henceforth, national, regional and local
public authorities provided specific funding and
open public databases to get innovative solutions
for modernising public services, with positive
effects on the social status of public jobs. By 2040,
highly skilled youth were attracted to the public
service and helped improve overall governance.

These transformations contributed indirectly also
to an improved social equity and participatory
democracy by 2040, thanks to much higher
efficiency of public action and information flows.

### Transformative elements of the transition pathway

- Member States actively shape behavioural
  change of citizens from consumerism
  to ecological consciousness through
  accelerating the broad adoption of
  technologies and use technologies to
  maximise their capacity to steer the
  change. Transparency of state actions
  and participatory decision-making
  strengthen the capacity for EU actors to
  act together and build trust between the
  state and citizens. The state is also able
  to effectively counter disinformation and
  enable fact-checking.

- States are forced to modernise their tax
  systems to ensure fiscal sustainability. They
  finally manage to shift taxes from labour to
  consumption, corporate income and wealth
  so as to improve social equity. The EU ensures
  taxation does not cause internal competition
  within Europe. International cooperation
  allows a harmonised introduction of similar
  measures in all large economies.

- Integrated policy mixes ensure that
  large-scale public investments in digital
  infrastructure and skills consolidate
  universal access to digitalised public
  services and participative tools, as well as
  widespread digital skills, also supporting
  digital entrepreneurship.

- State-led missions enable innovation and
  advanced technology, boosting the economy
  and public budgets. Advanced technology
  enables GDP growth with less resource use
  and improves the quality and efficiency of
  public services. Centralised governance has
  prevented radical innovation, and social and
  economic practices, structural relations and
  roles of the past persist.
