I am aware of the harmful consequences of current agricultural practices for future generations.
I am aware of the challenges to food security caused by climate change (e.g., droughts and floods affecting crops).
I am aware of the challenges to food availability caused by population growth and global warming (e.g., increased demand and loss of arable land).
I feel satisfaction when eating environmentally friendly foods.
I intend to regularly make environmentally friendly purchases in the future because I care about the environment.
